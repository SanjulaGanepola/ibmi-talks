# OSS Tools For System Management

Join us as we explore the world of open-source tools for system management, starting with fundamental concepts and progressing to practical applications on IBM i with Prometheus for operational monitoring and Grafana for data visualization. We will also introduce Manzan, IBM i's new open-source solution for seamless integration with modern infrastructure monitoring tools. Have you ever wanted to receive Slack notifications for critical system errors, or perhaps send syslogs directly to monitoring dashboards like Sentry or Grafana Loki? With Manzan, not only is all of this now possible, but it also unlocks the potential for AI-driven system management. Donâ€™t miss this opportunity to see how you can enhance your system's monitoring capabilities with minimal setup and maximum flexibility.

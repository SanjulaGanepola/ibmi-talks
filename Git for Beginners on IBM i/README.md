# Git for Beginners on IBM i

Join us for a deep dive into Git where you will learn the essential concepts every beginner should know â€” from basic commands to working with branches and resolving merge conflicts. Next, we will explore what the modern development lifecycle looks like for IBM i developers using Git which includes uncovering how objects get built and what tools you will leverage to develop locally on your PC. We will also showcase how to leverage CI/CD pipelines (via GitHub Actions) to automate builds, generate impact analysis, and even run RPG unit tests.

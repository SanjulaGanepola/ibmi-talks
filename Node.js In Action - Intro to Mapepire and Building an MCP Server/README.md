# Node.js In Action - Intro to Mapepire and Building an MCP Server

Join us for a demo-packed session on building modern applications in Node.js. We will start with an introduction to Mapepire, an open-source database connector designed to simplify connecting applications to Db2 on IBM i. Using Mapepire, we will build a simple Express-based REST API that communicates directly with the database, showcasing how quick and efficient data access can be. Then, we will take it a step further by creating an MCP (Multi-Client Protocol) server equipped with tools to interact with our database using Mapepire.
